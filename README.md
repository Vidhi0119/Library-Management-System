# Library-Management-System
Library management System is a small program to manage library.

In our project we will be able to classify users as staff or students Classifying users allows the book issue controls, fine rates based on the classification. For example for students we will be able to sue books at the fine rate of Rs. 2.4s late fee and books at the fine rate of Rs. 1 for Statis. What more, we can change this settings based on our needs but we have to set this values just one and not every time the program starts. We have used my settings class to implement this.
